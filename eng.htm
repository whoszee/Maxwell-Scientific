	<p>Spring is coming, and it's time for the annual toothpick bridge competition. Don't watch your bridges collapse! Instead come to Maxwell Scientific for high-quality materials and adhesives. Maxwell Scientific also provides educational material to teach basic engineering principles and help your students design the best structures. When it comes time to put those bridges to the test, look towards Maxwell Scientific for precision structure testers.</p>

		<h2>Featured Engineering Products</h2>
		<dd>Digital Force Gauge: Use this high-tech tool to accurately measure compression and tension up to 5000 grams. Four AA batteries required. Price $399.95 Stock Number: DFG4-412 </dd>
		<dd>Oersted had been using a strong battery in one of his lectures, and as he concluded his talk he placed a current-carrying wire over a compass. To his surprise, the compass begain to move quickly from the north direction to the east directon, as if it were in the presence of an intense magnetic field. Oersted reversed the flow of the electric current and the compass promptly began pointing west.</dd>
